When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you're collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you don't necessarilly want the latest updates from the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is when you copy a remote repository to your computer.  A fork is similar
	but it's a copy of a repository created on the GitHub server.  Branches are labels
	for commits.  I would clone a repository if I was going to make changes to 
	the files in the remote repository and was a contributor to the remote repository.
	I might also clone a repository if I just wanted a copy of the repository on my 
	computer.  I would fork a repository if I wanted to make my own version of another
	repository and share it with others.  I would make a branch if I was working on 
	changes to a shared repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
