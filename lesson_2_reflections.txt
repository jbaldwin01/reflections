What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It initializes a directory as a repository which creates the hidden .git 
	subdirectory and associated files needed for tracking changes to a git repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	It contains the files that will be committed to the repository.  The working directory
	may contain other files which will not be included in the commit.
